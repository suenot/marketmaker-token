## Tokenomics

The MM token is the native utility token of Marketmaker.cc, designed to align the platform’s success with its community. It serves as the heart of the Marketmaker.cc ecosystem, linking the platform’s achievements with the interests of its users and investors by combining practical utility for platform participants and investment appeal for token holders.

### Key Details
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000 MM tokens.
- **Initial Sale**: 500,000 MM tokens sold at 1 USDT each in the first round (raising $500,000 USDT).
- **Sale Platform**: Tokens will be available on a top decentralized exchange (DEX) on the TON network, such as **Ston.fi**, a leading DEX for TON, valued for its accessibility and growing ecosystem. Plans include listing on additional platforms.
- **Target Price in 2 Years**: 2 USDT (a 2x increase over 2 years).

### Token Utility
MM tokens offer a range of benefits within the platform, enhancing the user experience (specific uses to be finalized):
- **Service Discounts**: Users pay for services in USDT at a fixed price and receive a 20% discount when paying with MM tokens. Fixed USDT pricing ensures cost stability for users, while MM tokens provide added bonuses without being tied to their volatility.
- **Exclusive Access**: Holding or staking over 1,000 MM tokens in a liquidity pool unlocks premium features.
- **Governance Participation**: Future plans include enabling token holders to vote on new features, with MM tokens burned during the voting process.
- **Enhanced Data Parsing**: Accelerate data collection from specific exchanges and trading pairs.
- **Faster Order Execution**: Enable order placement on exchanges in as little as 3-5 milliseconds.
- **One-Time Access**: Unlock specific tools, metrics, signals, and bots with a single MM token payment.
- **General Uses**: Potentially pay transaction or subscription fees, unlock advanced analytics, or access exclusive strategies.

### Profit Distribution
- **100% of Net Profits**: Allocated to buy back MM tokens from the market.

### Buyback Mechanism
- Buybacks will occur evenly over time using orders on decentralized exchanges and smart contracts, with a fixed purchase price.
- The buyback price will be set by the project owner, reflecting market conditions and platform performance.
- This mechanism aims to reduce circulating supply over time, potentially increasing token value as platform revenue grows.

### Token Value
The value of MM tokens is closely tied to Marketmaker.cc’s success. As the platform generates income, buybacks will bolster token demand, linking token value directly to the startup’s financial performance.

### Sources of Platform Revenue
Token value growth is supported by Marketmaker.cc’s revenue streams, which fund buybacks:
- **Sales of Access**: Revenue from providing access to strategies, bots, and metrics (up to 30% of strategy profits).
- **Internal Strategy Use**: Profits from deploying trading strategies internally.
- **Exchange Partnerships**: Referral commissions from exchanges upon reaching 10,000+ users.

### First Round Sale
- **Smart Contract**: Send 1 USDT to the designated smart contract to receive 1 MM token instantly.
- **Ston.fi Availability**: Tokens will also be listed on Ston.fi, though buyers should be cautious of potential liquidity risks due to initial pool sizes.

### Future Rounds
Additional investment rounds may occur at the project owner’s discretion. These could be closed rounds or skipped if funding needs are met.

## Investment Opportunity

Marketmaker.cc offers an exciting opportunity for early investors:

- **Valuation**: $10M USDT (as of January 2025).
- **Pre-Seed Round**: 5% equity for $500k USDT.

This equity investment is separate from the token sale and targets supporters who wish to own a stake in the company. The $500k will accelerate development, bringing our platform to market faster. To participate, contact us via the provided investment link.

The initial token sale of 500,000 MM tokens at 1 USDT each ($500k total) serves as an additional funding mechanism, likely supporting liquidity or community-building efforts.

## How to Get Involved

### For Investors
- Participate in the pre-seed equity round for ownership in Marketmaker.cc.
- Purchase MM tokens in the first round via a smart contract on TON that accepts USDT and instantly sends back the equivalent in MM tokens.  
  Contract address: *<coming soon>*.
- Buy MM tokens through Ston.fi, where a liquidity pool already exists: [https://app.ston.fi/pools/EQAiFB53DSPF1Fvzymos8mR4xGHqXhyRSzT9LoRJzP8jl51g](https://app.ston.fi/pools/EQAiFB53DSPF1Fvzymos8mR4xGHqXhyRSzT9LoRJzP8jl51g).
