## Tokenomics

The MM token is the native utility token of Marketmaker.cc, designed to align the platform’s success with its community.

### Key Details
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000 MM tokens.
- **Initial Sale**: 100,000 MM tokens sold at 1 USDT each in the first round.
- **Sale Platform**: Tokens will be available on a top decentralized exchange (DEX) on the TON network. We recommend **Ston.fi**, a leading DEX for TON, for its accessibility and growing ecosystem.

### Token Utility
MM tokens will serve various purposes within the platform (to be finalized), potentially including:
- Paying transaction or subscription fees.
- Unlocking premium features like advanced analytics or exclusive strategies.
- Participating in governance decisions.

### Profit Distribution
- **50% of Profits**: Allocated to buy back MM tokens from the market.
- **50% of Profits**: Distributed to the project owners.

### Buyback Mechanism
- Buybacks will occur evenly over time using limit orders.
- The buyback price will be determined by the project owner, reflecting market conditions and platform performance.
- This process aims to reduce circulating supply over time, potentially increasing token value as platform income grows.

### Token Value
The value of MM tokens is tied to Marketmaker.cc’s success. As the platform generates revenue, buybacks will support token demand, linking token value to startup income.

### First Round Sale
- **Smart Contract**: Send 1 USDT to the designated smart contract to receive 1 MM token instantly.
- **Ston.fi Availability**: Tokens will also be listed on Ston.fi, though buyers should note potential liquidity risks due to initial pool sizes.

### Future Rounds
Additional investment rounds may occur based on the project owner’s discretion. These could be closed rounds or skipped entirely if funding needs are met.

## Investment Opportunity

Marketmaker.cc offers an exciting opportunity for early investors:

- **Valuation**: $10M USDT (as of January 2025).

This equity investment is separate from the token sale and targets supporters who wish to own a stake in the company. The $500k will accelerate development, bringing our platform to market faster. To participate, contact us via the provided investment link.
